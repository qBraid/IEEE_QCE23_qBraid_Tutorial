For example, $2^{1+2}=8=2^1 * 2^2$, doesn't seem to care whether you add the numbers in the exponential or multiple the exponentials of each individual exponent. The key thing to remember here is that the exponentials we work with are not simple numbers, they are matrices. Matrices have the important property that it matters in which order you multiply them, so that $MN \\neq NM$ for two matrices. The consequence of this is that we can decompose an exponential of sums of matrices into a product of exponentials of single matrices, but only as an approximation.\n",

The depth of the circuit (number of repetitions of these operators) and the parameters associated with these operators determine the quality of the approximation.\n",

However, gradient-based optimization in QAOA is not always employed, as it can sometimes be computationally expensive or challenging to implement.\n",
