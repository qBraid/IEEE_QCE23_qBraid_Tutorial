The rotation angle of each of the Pauli-rotation gates is a parameter that can be tuned.  A single-layer of PauliTwoDesign consists of a layer of CZ gates sandwiched between two layers of single qubit Pauli gates. With this setup, it allows us to span a relatively small subspace of the Hilbert space associated with qubits.

    "The above code shows how to get the minimum energy of the Hamiltonian using VQE. This procedure is the same as the procedure we used for smaller problems. But, here we can easily observe how the exact diagonalization does not scale well as the problem size grows. For our four spin system, the size of the matrix to be diagonalized is $16\\times 16$. For a system with $N$-spins, the size of the matrix to be diagonalized is $2^N\\times 2^N$, which for a few hundred spins is greater than the number of particles in the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why running VQE with a good ansatz is the best bet. As we saw in our first example, it is not gauranteed that it would converge to the global minimum if the subspace spanned by the ansatz generated by all the values of parameters, does not span the space in which the global minimum lies. This is where we can use knowledge from physics to design better ansatz and possibly find the global minimum.\n"
