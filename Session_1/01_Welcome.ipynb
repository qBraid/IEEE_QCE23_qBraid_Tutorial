    "We are so glad to welcome you to this two-part tutorial where we will introduce you to qBraid Lab and variational quantum algorithms over the course of two sessions! \n",
    "\n",
    "about qBraid: Our **mission** is to facilitate the quantum computing revolution; to do this, we are creating a *one-stop* platform for developing and running quantum algorithms, *as well as* learning about quantum computing. We believe that in order for the potential of quantum computing to be realized, for it to really be applied to all the fields it promises to revolutionize, it must be widely accessible. We are here to help the next generation of programmers to \"think quantum\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this welcome page, you will find: <br>\n",
    "1. <a href=\"#understanding_UI\">Instructions on how to navigate the User Interface</a> <br>\n",
    "2. <a href=\"#writing_program\">Instructions on how to write and run a quantum program on a real quantum computer! Don't worry if you don't completely understand all the details of the program. The point is to show that it is incredible simple to run programs on a real quantum computer.</a> <br>\n",
    "3. <a href=\"#overview\">Overview of the basic functions of qBraid Lab.</a> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "At qBraid, you can start developing and running quantum programs right away without having to install *anything* on your local machine. You will have access to state-of-the-art libraries for applications of quantum computing, and you will be able to run the quantum algorithms you develop on the state-of-the-art quantum hardware offered by providers around the world (note: *we* do not develop quantum hardware!). We believe that running a quantum program should be as simple as checking your email. To see this in action for yourself, run the following code cell to draw your first quantum circuit. You can click anywhere in the following code cell and press `Shift+Enter` to run it. Run the second code cell to execute the quantum circuit."
